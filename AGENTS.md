# AGENTS.md — circuit_solver_delta

## Rust toolchain

Cargo is installed via Homebrew rustup, not the default `rustup-init` path.
The binary lives at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/rustup/1.29.0_2/bin/cargo`.
Export `PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/rustup/1.29.0_2/bin:$PATH"` at the start
of every terminal session (or add it to `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`).

Active toolchain: nightly (set via `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` env var).

## Worktree setup

Worktrees for kanban tasks are created under `.worktrees/<task_id>/`.
Creation command from repo root:

```
git worktree add .worktrees/<task_id> -b <branch>
```

For this project the branch name is `ralph/circuit-solver-delta`.

## Crate structure

- `src/lib.rs`   — re-exports public surface from submodules
- `src/graph.rs` — `NodeId` newtype + `CircuitGraph` struct (US-001)

## US-001 patterns

- `NodeId` is a newtype `NodeId(usize)` with `From<usize>` and `From<NodeId>
  for usize` impls (not `Into` — the stdlib blanket handles that).
- `CircuitGraph::new()` seeds the ground node, setting `node_count = 1`.
- `CircuitGraph::default()` is derived and leaves `node_count = 0`; callers
  that want a properly-seeded graph must use `::new()`.
- Ground node index is always 0; exposed via `CircuitGraph::ground() -> NodeId`.

## Gotchas

- Do not implement `Into` manually — Rust provides a blanket `impl<T, U: From<T>>
  Into<T> for U`. Implementing both causes a compile error.
- `#[derive(Default)]` on `CircuitGraph` is intentional: it lets the struct be
  used in aggregate `Default` derives for parent structs, but consumers should
  use `::new()` for correct initial state.
